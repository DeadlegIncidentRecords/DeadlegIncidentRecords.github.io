## **Here is a list of artists that are currently a part of the Deadleg Incident Records lineup, as well as their respective bios**


# **Animal Afterlife Society**
<blockquote>Animal Afterlife Society is the experimental side project of Heaven Of Animals which tampers in more accessible music and use of conventional instruments. Some frequent genres may include folk, post-rock, post-punk, krautrock, and various forms of metal.</blockquote>


# **Dantanian**
<blockquote>Dantanian is the collaborative effort of both Heaven Of Animals and Aether, bringing heavy droning and noisy textures, ear-tearing screams of distorted feedback, and heavy thematic power electronics.</blockquote>


# **Heaven Of Animals**
<blockquote>Heaven Of Animals is the mastermind behind Deadleg Incident Records. They develop experimental and heavy noise, ranging from loud and bassy harsh noise wall, to musique-concrete noise compositions using shortwave radio transmissions.</blockquote>


# **Project 6** (On indefinite hiatus)
<blockquote>Project 6 was a pre-Deadleg project started and ended by Heaven Of Animals. It featured an experimental release of sample-based harsh noise, as well as some noise rock.</blockquote>


# **Spacial Absence**
<blockquote>Spacial Absence is the wall noise alias of Aether, dedicated to pursuing subtle evolution and originality within a genre that suffocates both.</blockquote>
