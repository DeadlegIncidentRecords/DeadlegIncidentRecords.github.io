<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are Deadleg Incident Records, a group of artists started by Heaven Of Animals aimed to empower experimental musicians and to promote and produce avant-garde compositions and projects that span over many genres. These can include noise, drone, ambient, folk, metal, rock, electronics, or anything really! Not only do we experiment in music, we also dabble in the world of traditional and visual arts, photography, and literature. We hope you enjoy our catalog and feel free to send us a message or a comment!</p><br>
