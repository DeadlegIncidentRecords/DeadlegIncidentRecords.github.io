Greetings. Animal Afterlife Society here, announcing the release of my debut album.<br>
It is titled: "Death Encircles Mount Obscuro"<br><br>

This project is a heavy drone metal album that I made while being depressed and laying on my bed.<br>
All that was used was a 4 string Ibanez bass tuned to BEAD, a Spider effects amp, and a trashy laptop.<br>
Bass > Amp with reverb and distortion and compression and stuff > DAW with a bunch of dumb effects.<br>
This project came from a deep spot in my heart and hopefully I will sleep better now that I let a demon out.<br><br>

Sorry for the rant, here is the album. You can download it for free, stream it, or pay whatever you want.<br>
Enjoy:<br>
